    <p class="about">
        I was born in Denver Colorado and lived there for half of my life. When I was a little kid I liked to just watch movies and hangout with family. 
        We then moved to Florida for Disneyworld. During the three years we did nothing but going to beaches and Disney.
        For the next year me and my family went all around the country for my moms travel nursing opprotunities until we decided to settle in California
        The best years were spent in Cali, growing up and making lots of friends in the three short years.
        To be moved to Utah where I'll be spending the rest of highschool

    <p class="about">
        I spend my time on a variety of different things. But I find myself spending the most time playing basketball and working towards making varsity again. Other than that I help work on 
        car with my dad and help sell parts. If I ever find myself bored i'll try to learn a new recipe to cook.
